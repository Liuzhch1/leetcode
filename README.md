This repository recodes my solutions for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/u/dreaming-reality/) problems.

## Proposal

Using this repository record my solutions, seeing the pushing commits inspire me to move on.

## Folders

**./Hot-100** are from [LeetCode热题 HOT 100](https://leetcode.cn/problem-list/2cktkvj/), the first half of the solution was written in C++, and later changed to Java. Cause I decided to position my career planning on back-end development, and Java is the most popular one.
All problems(except Premuim Prolems) are finished.

**./Everyday** are problems of everyday. Recording problems since 2022.8.1

**./剑指Offer专项突击** are problems from [剑指 Offer（专项突击版）](https://leetcode.cn/study-plan/lcof/?progress=kft43kc), which helps me exercise each field of problem, such as Integer, Arrays, DP, Tree, Graph, etc.
